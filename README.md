# Data Analytics Portfolio
Data analytic projects completed by me for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. 

The projects are presented on R and Python using Jupyter Notebook. I showcase also my projects on Tableau, PowerBi and some academic presentations on Powerpoint. 

You can find more about me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ffmc">Linkedin profile.</a>
